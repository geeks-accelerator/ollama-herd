# Known Issues & Improvements

Identified via code review of the full codebase. Organized by priority.

**Status key:** `OPEN` — not yet addressed. `PARTIAL` — partially fixed. `FIXED` — resolved.

---

## Performance (Will Bite at Scale)

### 1. `LatencyStore.get_percentile()` — Unbounded Memory Growth `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/latency_store.py`
**Severity:** High

`get_percentile()` loads ALL historical latency rows into memory every time a latency observation is recorded. For a high-traffic deployment with thousands of observations per `(node, model)` pair, this grows without bound.

**Fix:** Cap to the last N observations (e.g., 100–1000) using a `LIMIT` clause, or use SQLite's `percent_rank()` window function to compute percentiles in SQL.

---

### 2. `_refresh_cache()` — N+1 Query Pattern `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/latency_store.py`
**Severity:** Medium

On startup, `_refresh_cache()` first queries all distinct `(node_id, model_name)` pairs, then issues a separate `get_percentile()` call for each pair. For a fleet with many node/model combinations, this means dozens of sequential SQLite round-trips.

**Fix:** Replace with a single query that computes all percentiles at once, or fetch all observations in one `SELECT` and compute percentiles in Python.

---

### 3. `in_flight` List — O(n) Membership and Removal `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/queue_manager.py` (lines ~117–129)
**Severity:** Low–Medium

The `in_flight` field on each queue is a `list`. Both `in` checks and `.remove()` are O(n). Under high concurrency with deep queues, this becomes a bottleneck.

**Fix:** Use a `set` or `dict` keyed by `request_id` for O(1) operations.

---

## Code Quality

### 4. `_request_tokens` Dict — Leaking Internal State `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/streaming.py`
**Severity:** Low

Route handlers in `openai_compat.py` and `ollama_compat.py` access the private `proxy._request_tokens` dict directly via `.pop()`. This breaks encapsulation and couples route logic to an internal implementation detail.

**Fix:** Expose a public method like `pop_token_counts(request_id)` on `StreamingProxy`.

---

### 5. `asyncio.ensure_future` — Deprecated API `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/common/discovery.py` (line ~65)
**Severity:** Low

`asyncio.ensure_future()` has been deprecated since Python 3.10 in favor of `asyncio.create_task()`. The project requires Python 3.11+, so this should be updated.

**Fix:** Replace `asyncio.ensure_future(...)` with `asyncio.create_task(...)`.

---

### 6. Unused Dependencies and Imports `OPEN`

**Files:** `pyproject.toml`, `src/fleet_manager/server/app.py`
**Severity:** Low

- `sse-starlette` is listed in `pyproject.toml` but never imported in the source code.
- `pyyaml` is listed in `pyproject.toml` but never imported in the source code.
- `StaticFiles` is imported in `app.py` but never used.

**Fix:** Remove unused dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and the dead import from `app.py`.

---

### 7. `HeartbeatPayload.arch` — Hardcoded Default `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/models/` (HeartbeatPayload definition)
**Severity:** Low

The `arch` field defaults to `"apple_silicon"`, which is incorrect for non-Mac nodes (e.g., Linux/x86 or Linux/ARM).

**Fix:** Default to `platform.machine()` or similar runtime detection.

---

### 8. `event_stream()` Re-fetches State Every Tick `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/routes/dashboard.py`
**Severity:** Low

The SSE `event_stream()` function re-fetches `request.app.state` on every tick (every 2 seconds). The references should be captured once before the loop starts.

**Fix:** Capture `registry = request.app.state.registry` etc. before entering the `while True` loop.

---

### 9. Dashboard Inline HTML/CSS/JS — Growing Maintenance Burden `OPEN`

**File:** `src/fleet_manager/server/routes/dashboard.py`
**Severity:** Low (for now)

The dashboard is a large amount of inline HTML/CSS/JS in Python strings across 5 pages (Fleet Overview, Trends, Model Insights, Apps, Benchmarks). This is pragmatic for a single-file deployment but will become painful as more dashboard features are added (e.g., tag filtering on Trends/Models views).

**Fix:** When the dashboard grows further, extract to Jinja2 templates or a separate frontend build.

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

### 10. Untested Modules `PARTIAL`

**Severity:** Medium

The following modules still have zero test coverage:

- `server/rebalancer.py` — pre-warm trigger and queue move logic
- `common/discovery.py` — mDNS advertise and browse
- `common/system_metrics.py` — psutil metric collection
- `common/ollama_client.py` — Ollama HTTP client

Previously untested, now covered:
- ~~`node/agent.py`~~ — now has 6 tests in `tests/test_node/test_agent.py`

The rebalancer in particular has meaningful logic (deciding when to move pending requests, triggering pre-warm) that warrants unit tests.

---

### 11. `test_move_pending` — Tautological Assertion `OPEN`

**File:** `tests/test_server/test_queue_manager.py`
**Severity:** Low

The test asserts `moved >= 0`, which is always true for a non-negative integer. This assertion provides no verification that entries were actually moved.

**Fix:** Assert `moved >= 1` or verify the target queue received the expected entries.

---

### 12. `test_shutdown` — Vacuous Test `OPEN`

**File:** `tests/test_server/test_queue_manager.py`
**Severity:** Low

The test body is `pass  # No assertion needed`. It only verifies that no exception is raised, which provides minimal confidence.

**Fix:** Assert post-shutdown state — e.g., that worker tasks are cancelled, queues are empty, or new enqueues are rejected.

---

## Known Limitations

### 13. Meeting Detector False Positives on Dev Machines

**Severity:** Low

The macOS meeting detector (`node/meeting_detector.py`) detects active camera/microphone as "in meeting" and triggers a hard pause. Developers using webcam-based tools (video calls, streaming, screen sharing) during development will get false positives, causing the node to stop accepting work.

**Workaround:** Set `FLEET_NODE_ENABLE_CAPACITY_LEARNING=false` (the default) to disable meeting detection entirely. Tests use `@patch.object(MeetingDetector, "is_in_meeting", return_value=False)` to work around this.

---

### 14. Capacity Learning 7-Day Bootstrap Period

**Severity:** Low

The capacity learner requires 7 days of real observations to graduate from "bootstrapping" to "learned" mode. During the bootstrap period, the learner contributes less confidence to routing decisions. This cannot be validated in automated tests — it requires a week of real usage.

**Workaround:** Pre-seed the capacity learner JSON file with synthetic data if faster convergence is needed.

---

### 15. Tag Filtering Not Yet on Trends/Models Views

**Severity:** Low (feature gap)

The tagging system records tags on every trace and provides a dedicated Apps dashboard tab. However, the existing Trends and Model Insights views cannot yet be filtered by tag. Adding tag-based filtering to these views is a natural next step.

---

### 16. OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL Auto-Calculation Causes KV Cache Bloat and Model Thrashing `OPEN`

**Severity:** High

On high-memory machines (e.g., 512GB Mac Studio), Ollama's `auto` setting for `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` calculates a high slot count (e.g., 16). Each parallel slot pre-allocates KV cache for the full context window. With 16 slots and `default_num_ctx=262144`:

```
KV cache per model = 262144 ctx × 16 parallel = 4,194,304 KvSize → 384 GB
```

A single model consumes ~413 GB (17 GB weights + 384 GB KV cache + 12 GB compute), leaving no room for other models on a 464 GB VRAM machine. When a second model is requested, Ollama evicts the first — and vice versa — creating a thrashing loop that freezes the machine for 10-60 seconds per swap.

**Symptoms:**
- Models drop to 0 loaded at regular intervals (visible in herd dashboard and heartbeat data)
- Ollama logs show `"model requires more gpu memory than is currently available, evicting a model to make space"` repeatedly
- Machine freezes during model swaps (loading 88-151 GB models saturates memory bandwidth)
- `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1` alone does NOT fix this — eviction is space-based, not time-based

**Evidence:** Ollama server logs (`~/.ollama/logs/server-*.log`) showed eviction cascades at hourly intervals coinciding with bot-simulation model rotation. KV cache sizes confirmed via `load request` log entries showing `KvSize:4194304` with `Parallel:16`.

**Fix (user-side):** Set `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=2` (or 3-4). KV cache drops to ~20 GB per model, allowing 3-4 large models to coexist.

```bash
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL 2
# Restart Ollama
```

**Potential fix (Herd-side):** The router could detect this condition by comparing a node's reported VRAM against loaded model count and warn in the dashboard. Or Herd could inject `num_ctx` overrides in proxied requests to cap context windows and prevent KV cache explosion.

## Future Considerations

- **Extract dashboard frontend** — see issue #9 above
- **`event_stream()` optimization** — see issue #8 above
- **Tag filtering on Trends/Models** — see issue #15 above
- **`collector.py` catch-all** — silently returns empty metrics when Ollama is unreachable, which could mask bugs during development. Consider logging at `WARNING` level.
